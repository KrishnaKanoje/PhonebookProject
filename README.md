# PhonebookProject
A Phonebook CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is a simple yet fundamental example of database operations typically used for managing contacts. Here's a summary of how such an application would function:

Create (C):
Users can add new contacts to the phonebook. This involves entering details such as name, phone number, email address, etc.
Input validation ensures that required fields are filled and data is correctly formatted.
Upon submission, the contact details are saved to a database.



Read (R):
Users can view a list of all contacts currently stored in the phonebook.
Optionally, they can search for specific contacts based on criteria such as name or phone number.
The application retrieves data from the database and displays it in a user-friendly format.

Update (U):
Users can modify existing contact details. This includes changing the phone number, updating the email address, etc.
Similar to the create operation, input validation ensures that changes are correctly applied and stored.

Delete (D):
Users can delete contacts from the phonebook when they are no longer needed.
Confirmation prompts may be used to prevent accidental deletion.
The application removes the selected contact from the database.
